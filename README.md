# Vulkan Project

This is a personal project using the Vulkan API. It follows vkguide.dev. My goal with this project is to mainly learn Vulkan, and to also use it as a base to create a voxel render after I become comfortable with using the API. 

Many parts of the source code have extensive comments that explains concepts relating to Vulkan, or just parts of the code that may seem non-trivial. They are left there as to help with learning, maintain some sort of documentation for myself (despite it being very messy!), and to also show (to myself) that I'm not necessarily "blindly" following along with the guide.
